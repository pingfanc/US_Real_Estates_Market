# USA Real Estate Information Database project
This project is designed to build a database for the real estate market in the States, so it can extract more features when predicting the future. This repository is created for a group coursework project with a team of 5 UCL MSBA students.

**Keywords:** database, SQL, MongoDB, DuckDB, spark, pandas

## Data Acquisition
There are three different types of data resources which come from API, web scraping, and Excel documents. These data are first stored in Postgres and MongoDB (OLTP database), then transformed into DuckDB for further analysis as it is an OLAP database. 

## Future steps
Build it into automation pipeline with AWS
